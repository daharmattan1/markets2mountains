## About Markets2Mountains

Welcome to Markets2Mountains - where I explore the paths from ambition to achievement, markets to mindset, and valleys to peaks.

## About Victor

I'm a GTM executive, AI builder, and father of two who has spent 15 years scaling B2B SaaS companies from early stage to sustained growth.

**Current Role:** Growth Leader at [Pixee](https://pixee.ai), an AI-powered application security company

**Background:**
- 15+ years scaling B2B SaaS GTM at CB Insights, BurnAlong, and Pixee
- Two successful exits, sustained 2-3x growth across multiple companies
- 2.5 years building AI-powered GTM systems and strategies
- Former board member at CLAL (Center for Learning and Leadership)

**What I Write About:**
- **Markets:** Finance, investing, business strategy, and economic thinking
- **Mindset:** Productivity systems, mental models, and personal effectiveness
- **Management:** Leadership principles, team building, and operational excellence
- **Mountains:** Life philosophy, personal growth, and the journey itself

**My Approach:**

I'm a practitioner first. Everything I write comes from real experience - scaling teams, building systems, making mistakes, and learning what actually works in the trenches of high-growth companies.

I blend stoic philosophy with modern productivity, financial thinking with human psychology, and strategic frameworks with tactical execution. The goal is always the same: practical wisdom you can actually use.

**CliftonStrengths Top 5:** Deliberative, Strategic, Achiever, Relator, Learner

**Beyond Work:**

Father of two young kids, Quaker, aspiring long-distance backpacker, and believer that the best insights come from the intersection of different worlds.
