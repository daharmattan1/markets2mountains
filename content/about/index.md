# About Victor

I'm Victor Sowers - a GTM executive, startup operator, and father of two trying to figure out how to build meaningful things while staying present.

## What I Do

I've spent 15 years scaling B2B SaaS companies from early-stage to exits. Currently, I'm building AI-powered growth systems at Pixee (application security) and helping startups navigate the intersection of AI and go-to-market strategy.

Career highlights: VP Revenue Operations at CB Insights (grew revenue 60x), VP Strategy & Operations at BurnAlong (800% ARR growth, acquired by Tivity Health), founder of GoStudy (edtech, 2011-2015).

## What I Write About

This blog explores the intersection of markets (GTM, startups, strategy) and mountains (productivity, philosophy, what matters). Topics include:

- **GTM + AI**: How AI is changing go-to-market strategy
- **Productivity**: Systems for getting things done (The Victor Method)
- **Operator lessons**: Practical insights from scaling companies
- **Philosophy**: Stoicism, Quakerism, tea, and not letting life pass you by

## Beyond Work

Father of two young kids. Quaker. Long-distance backpacker. Terrible at keeping my tea from getting cold.
