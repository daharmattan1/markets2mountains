This is a test post to verify images work correctly.

## Inline Image

Here's an inline image:

![Test Image](/images/test-image.png)

Images should:
- Load correctly
- Be responsive
- Look good in light/dark mode

## Next Steps

When migrating your blog posts:
1. Copy images from WordPress to `/static/images/`
2. Reference them with `/images/filename.jpg`
3. Add `featuredImage` in frontmatter for hero images

Delete this test post when you're ready to go live.
