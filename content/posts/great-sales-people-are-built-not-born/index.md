Over the last 4 years I’ve been part of promoting 24+ folks from the sales (business) development rep (SDR/BDR) role. Most of these SDRs have gone from college to their first closing role as an AE at an enterprise SaaS company within 18-24 months.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">It’s awesome to watch young, talented, and hungry junior sales people have the chance to accelerate their careers. It’s also given me perspective on what it takes to succeed in B2B enterprise SaaS sales. And what it takes is *a lot*.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">The failure rate of a first time AE is substantial. It’s not just not easy to move from setting appointments to closing five or six figure deals. So congratulations on moving up. Time to get serious.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">This post identifies gaps in the training of most junior sales people and points those junior sales reps to valuable resources they can learn from.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">I do this by identifying six parts of sales that are often overlooked in the formal professional development you are likely to get. Within each of these areas I give you a list of resources that you can use teach yourself.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">The six areas of knowledge I’m going to cover are:

<ul style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">
	<li>Gap 1: Understanding the role of sales within the whole company (so you don’t look stupid)</li>
	<li>Gap 2: Knowing the things your boss cares about</li>
	<li>Gap 3: The Landscape of Sales Methodologies</li>
	<li>Gap 4: There’s no Sale Without a Lead (Sales and Demand Gen)</li>
	<li>Gap 5: Psychology, Stories, and the Art of the Sale</li>
	<li>Gap 6: Internalizing that it’s actually all on you</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">While both my list and the list of resources are necessarily incomplete, it's a curated set of reference material you can't go wrong with, and I'm confident it will give you a leg up.

<h3 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">Gap 1: Understanding how sales fits within the whole company (so you don’t look stupid)</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">As an SDR you come into the working world, usually straight from school or via an unrelated career, and get thrown into the deep end without much fanfare.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Within a couple of weeks you’ve learned a script, gotten a basic grasp of your company’s buyer and all of a sudden you’re on the phone, emailing dozens, perhaps hundreds of prospects. You learn that sales is tough. You start dreaming about your quota number. You also build a bond with the other sales reps grinding next to you. Camaraderie is inevitably built one rejection at a time.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Gradually you get more sophisticated. You learn a bit about what works and you get more comfortable in understanding what you need to do (inputs) in order to hit to meet your number. With the basics down, great reps will start spending more and more of their time on (1) the ins-and-outs of their product and (2) their customer's needs, pain points, corporate structures etc.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">*But rarely in this process does anyone take a step back and talk to you about how sales fits into and interacts with the rest of the company.*

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">This is a problem and here's why.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">The truth is that sales occupies a unique and often tension filled niche within a company.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">At least some people at your company think that: (1) sales is easy or even unnecessary, (2) you're overpaid, (3) your team is loud and obnoxious, (4) you sell deals that are bad for the company, (5) your team is full of bros and has a sh*tty culture that's nothing like the rest of the company.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">These are stereotypes. And right or wrong, true or not, you are part of the sales team and you must be aware of these biases in order to avoid coming across as ignorant, or worse, unintentionally insulting.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Once you understand the role of sales and understand how it fits within your company's specific stage of growth you can deliberately build relationships with other teams that *shatter *their preconceived notions. Trust me, this understanding plus a basic grasp of how a company scales will put you miles ahead reputation-wise relative to other sales reps at your company.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);"><span style="font-weight: 600;">How do you gain this perspective?</span>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">In my opinion the best place to learn these lessons comes from the resources that VCs and certain "been-there-done-that" sales leaders have put together for teaching technical start-up founders about sales.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resources on Sales and Scaling a Company:</span>

<ul style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">

</ul>
<h3 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">Gap 2: Understanding what Sales Leadership cares about</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Remember that boss of yours? A sneak peek at your boss(es) and what they and what they care about is just common sense. This includes: (1) what they look for, (2) what they're judged on, (3) what they do day-to-day, and (4) how they're paid.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">This list tackles some of the above:

<ul style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">

</ul>
<h3 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">Gap 3: There’s a lot of ways to sell (Sales Methodologies)</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Chances are your company has a sales methodology, either implicitly or explicitly. This might be one of the well-known rubrics out there like Sandler or the Challenger Sale, it might be a mash-up of many, or it’s home grown. Either way, you’ll pick up some strategies/techniques from all of the various models, and you’ll get a better sense of your field that is especially useful when you’re looking for a new job somewhere down the road at the same time.

</ul>
<h3 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">Gap 4: There’s no Sale Without a Lead (or the Role of Demand Gen and Marketing)</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">There's no sales without a prospect, and prospects come from a strong lead generation effort that involves sales and marketing.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">But most sales people don't spend enough time understanding either (a) demand gen, or (b) marketing as a discipline.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">After all when was the last time you thought about a commercial on TV as part of a sales process? The reality is that sales is about solving a problem someone has, and part of that means making them aware of that problem in the first place.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">I truly believe that in broadening your understanding of selling, and truthfully, of social psychology you’ll innately become a more aware sales rep.

</ul>
<h3 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">Gap 5: Sales is a Discipline of many other Disciplines (or why you’re framework of sales is too narrow)</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Some of the below are sort of ‘memoirs’ of successful people in sales and marketing. Sometimes these types of books are great and entertaining. More often, they’re awful. Here are some that I think are great:

<ul style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">
	<li>*My Life in Advertising* – Claude Hopkins. One of the early successful marketers in America. This is a wildly entertaining and educational book that takes you into another era</li>

	<li>*How I raised myself from Failure to Success in Selling* – Frank Bettger</li>
	<li>*How to Win Friends and Influence People *– Dale Carnegie. An all-time classic that you'll hear cited over and over. Might as well read it now</li>
	<li>*The Art of the Sale *– Philip Delves Broughton</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">Gap 6: Not Taking Responsibility for Your Own Learning</h3>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">No matter how innately talented you think you are, succeeding in modern enterprise sales is a learned process. It takes time and effort. That is after all the whole point of this post.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">So what should you expect as you take your next step?

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">When you first move to an AE role you should expect a structured learning program covering sales fundamentals and the specifics of your product and sale. Note: if you’re at a company where the sales is team is >25 people and you don’t have this that is a HUGE red flag.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">But even if you get good training, you can’t rely only on company-provided training to give you everything you need to succeed.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">A company sales program is designed to teach you to sell one product within the specific context of your company. That means the training is specialized and deep in some areas, but likely to ignore or spend comparatively little time in other, sometimes broader areas of selling. Besides, think about how much knowledge lives outside of your organization vs. within its walls. You owe it to yourself to figure out what you don’t know you don’t know, because truth #1 in sales is, you own your own results.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Resources on Learning</span>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Note these are the least directly “sales”, feel free to skip ahead)

<ul style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">
	<li>*Levels of the Game *– John McPhee</li>
	<li>*The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance *- Anyone who is both a Chessmaster and world martial art champion (in Tai Chi Chuan) is worth listening to. Josh Waitzkin is that person</li>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">In summary, it's on you.
